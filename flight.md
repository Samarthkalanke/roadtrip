# Getting Back Home from Columbus

![](images/plane.jpg)

We plan on flying home from Columbus. We will figure out all the logistics once we get there. If all goes smoothly, we will sell the RV in Columbus and use that money to catch a plane back home. However, if we are unable to sell, we will drive the RV into the Scioto River, hijack a plane, and fly it either back to San Diego or some other place to hide from the FBI.
