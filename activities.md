# Potential activities
Much of our trip will be based on our moods and the things which we encounter. Some potential activities are listed below

## Las Vegas

Our route goes through Las Vegas, Nevada. Depending on our energy level, we may choose to spend time exploring the strip, eating lots of great food, and maybe making a little bit of money on the side.

## Hike in Colorado

As we drive through the rockies, if we have the time and energy we could spend some time exploring the beautiful nature which the mountains have to offer.

## Nebraska

Nobody knows what goes on in Nebraska. I guess we'll find out!

## Ohio State Basketball Game
