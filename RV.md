# Our Vehicle

![](images/rv.Png)

We will be driving the Winnebago View, one of the best RVs the market has to offer. We felt this was the right choice for the trip based on the picture above, where we felt the need to experience the road trippin' experience for ourselves as we saw how much the people in the picture were enjoying it. As mentioned in the schedule, we plan on dumping the brand new vehicle into the Scioto River in Columbus before hijacking a plane back to San Diego.
